# OpenMaths

The way Mathematics should have been done...

## The development bible:

- document your code
- commit often
- follow [this successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) -> use branches properly
- take the time to **do things properly**, rather than in a BO-ey (hacky), slapdash way

## Features
- OpenMaths is **completely open**
- Instead of expanding dependencies and prerequisites in separate tabs, we feature a **flexible grid** enabling users to perceive knowledge as a whole
- Our custom IDE features **automatic checker** and validator
- We enable users to utilise a wide range of LaTeX **macros**, including text-based macros, in addition to our own markup, which gets parsed as pure HTML
- We are using our own flat-file **Key-Value store with imbedded version control**
- Users only need a **Google account** in order to create their OpenMaths profile and contribute
- We do not run ads and do not store any sensitive user data, we pride ourselves on security and transparency, hence **OPEN**
- Our app is written in **Scala** (Back-End) and **Angular JS** (Front-End)
