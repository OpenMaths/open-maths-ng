# OpenMaths

The way Mathematics should have been done...

## The development bible:

- write verbose documentation
- use atomic commits
- follow [this git branching and tagging guide](http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf)
- take the time to **do (not only write) things properly**, rather than in a hacky, slapdash way
