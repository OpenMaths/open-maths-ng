# OpenMaths

The way Mathematics should have been done...

## The development bible:

- document your code
- commit often
- follow [this git branching and tagging guide](http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf) -> use branches
- take the time to **do (not only write) things properly**, rather than in a hacky, slapdash way
