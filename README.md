# OpenMaths

The way Mathematics should be done...

## Security

Please make sure the cryptographic certificate says **openmaths.io** or **sni26604.cloudflaressl.com**.

## The development bible:

- document your code **where it is needed**
- commit **often**
- follow [this successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) -> **use branches**, they exist for a reason!!
- take the time to **do things properly**, try not to hack things

## Features
- OpenMaths is **completely open**
- Instead of expanding dependencies and prerequisites in separate tabs, we feature a **flexible grid** enabling users to perceive knowledge in a different way
- Our custom IDE features **automatic grammar checker** and **proof checker**
- We enable users to utilise a wide range of LaTeX **macros**, including text-based macros, in addition to our own markup, which gets parsed into HTML
- We are using our own flat-file **Key-Value store with imbedded version control**
- Users only need a **Google account** in order to create their OpenMaths profile and contribute
- We do not run ads and do not store any sensitive user data, we pride ourselves on security and transparency, hence **OPEN**
- Our app is written in **Scala** (Back-End) and **Angular JS** (Front-End)!!
