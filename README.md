# OpenMaths

The way Mathematics should have been done...

## The development bible:

- document your code
- commit often
- follow [this git branching and tagging guide](http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf) -> use branches
- take the time to **do (not only write) things properly**, rather than in a hacky, slapdash way

## Features
- OpenMaths is completely open
- Instead of expanding dependencies and prerequisites in separate tabs, we feature a flexible grid enabling users to perceive knowledge as a whole
- Our custom IDE features automatic checker and validator
- We enable users to utilise a wide range of LaTeX macros, including text-based macros, in addition to our own markup, which gets parsed as pure HTML
- We are using our own flat-file DB system with imbedded version control
- Users only need a Google account in order to create their OpenMaths profile and contribute
- Our Front-End is written in Angular JS
